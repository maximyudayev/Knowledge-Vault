# Android
- Open-source operating system for mobile devices.
- Allows to create devices that port to the same user experience and ecosystem, accessories compatible with Android devices, and to create custome versions of Android OS.
- Stable, production-quality operating system for consumer products.

SoC designers place device-specific low-level software into the /vendor partition on the device. The framework is then updated OTA without recompiling the [[Hardware Abstraction Layer]]s. Clear separation and interface between device-specific code and the device-independent operating system framework: no need to change portions of the code to make it compatible, just replace the lego blocks.
