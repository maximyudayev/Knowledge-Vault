## Class 2
### Useful Collocations
![[Vocabulary Wordbook#Vocabulary Wordbook]]
### Relative Clauses
Relative clauses add conciseness and density to the ideas.
Restrictive and non-restrictive:
1. no commocation specializes the context, narrowing it down (restrictive).
2. commocation indicates that it is additional information that does not alter the main meaning of the sentence (non-restrictive).
If it is extra information, comma; if it is a continuation of the idea, no comma.
### Exercises

1. By contrast, groups that are marginalized tend to have more negative experiences.
2. Consider, for example, the way in which political socialization occurs in nations that allow only one political party.
3. This procedure yields more accurate results than the standard method, which relies on a single observation and is thus more prone to experimental error.
#### 2.2
1. After almost three years of putting this system into practice, different issues arise, some of which we will discuss in greater depth.
2. Only two studies have specifically dealt with this issue, both of which were reviewed earlier.
3. Finally, section 4 identifies several conditions under which screening is effective.
4. Previous research has offered at least two possible explanations, neither of which seems wholly satisfactory.
5. He argued in favor of the simple view of colors, which are real properties of objects.
#### 2.3
1. His research provided the basis on which these criteria were selected.
2. All the studies explore the means by which brain processes language.
3. Hence, there are to levels of analysis at which this issue is addressed.
### Bio Abstract
Maxim Yudayev obtained a Master's degree in Electronics and ICT Engineering Technology from KU Leuven. Prior to moving to Belgium, he spent three years in California, learning about the tech entrepreneurial world and studying at the University of California, which he later dropped out of. During his studies, Maxim was extracurricularly active and participated in numerous tech and business oriented student competitions and hackathons, side projects and freelance. After finishing his Master's, Maxim interned at the Nokia Bell Labs research group in Antwerp, where he developed a new mechanism to accelerate Artificial Intelligence [AI] on custom processors. He works as a PhD researcher at STADIUS (KU Leuven), integrating AI into target hardware devices and automating the process of co-design of AI-enabled hardware. Maxim is also socially active, organizing socio-educational activities for Ukrainian refugees coming to Belgium. He is an aspiring entrepreneur, who uses his engineering background to develop technologies that will improve the quality of life of prisoners, will give them knowledge, skills, and fulfilling employment opportunities in the technical domains, like advanced manufacturing and IT.
#### Remarks
Add dates and durations. Make it more chronological. Use alternative word to like to show the impression that you know what you are talking about.
## Class 3
### One Idea Paragraph
Internal structure of a paragraph:
1. Topic sentence - introduction of the idea.
2. Development/elaboration
3. Summary/recap

Problems:
1. Does not have a clear topic, context seems to be missing.
2. If the paragraph exceeds the scope of the topic sentence, you can extend the scope of the topic sentence by providing more context or generalizing the topic sentence. Does everything I say refers to the topic sentence of the paragraph? If not, start a new paragraph.
3. Length: too short and too long.

### How to Create Cohesion
1. Link words - connectives:
	1. Explicitly explain the meaning relationship between sentences using adverbs and connectors.
	2. Adverbs can be rephrased for a lexically equivalent longer sentences.
	3. Mix adverbs with lexical equivalents to create stronger links to previous sentences.
	4. They are lengthier, might not prefer if trying to word limit.
2. Given-new principle - starting the sentence with the idea introduced in a previous sentence and ending with an emphasis of the new idea (domino pattern of understanding chain).
3. Advanced organisers - 
4. Parallelism - useful intential repetition, using same words, little variation, or same grammatical form. Functional repetition.
	1. Be consistent with enumerations.
	2. Avoid beating around the bush.

## Class 4
### Brevity
1. Omit needless words - say the same thing in few words.
2. Avoid redundancy - avoid literal repetition.
3. Be brief - use premodifiers and compound nouns that are moved before the noun.
4. Use nouns and verbs effectively.
5. Possessives are resereved to people, countries and times.

## Class 5
Title should be informative and include all relevant information. Narrow down what type of research it is. Clear and concise. (~12 is good for APA). Include searchable keywords. Attractive to the reader.
Maximal capitalisation - all words capitalised except articles, propositions and conjuctions.
Minimal capitalisation - only the first word of the title and subtitle.
Colon + additional information that specifies the
