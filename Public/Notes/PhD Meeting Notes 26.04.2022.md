# PhD Meeting Notes 26.04.2022
- Calculate MAC ops, parameters and memory in each layer.
- Take a baseline CONV2D accelerator architecture with its data orchestration technique.
- Based on the desired throughput, calculate bandwidth required.
- Propose a customized, optimized architecture with data orchestration method.
- 8-bit quantization. Abstain from quantization-aware training: no conceptual difference for the hardware study, marginal difference for the model's performance.
