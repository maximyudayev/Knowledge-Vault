# Ukraine KU Leuven Meeting Notes 28.04.2022
## Ideas
1. Access to ongoing lectures (technical and non-technical).
2. Organizing mini-projects with student engineering teams for visiting students: compose teams of current and visiting students.
3. Mentorship/friendship with staff and students.
## Next Steps
1. Merge the lists of interested and potential newcomers.
2. Connect newcomers with student-/staff- mentors.
3. Contact engineering teams for mini projects.
4. Contact professors willing to admit visiting students.
5. [After quality validation] Share information with more people and/or share the framework with other faculties/universities.
## Notes
1. Prior information was not targeted -> low conversion.
2. Once the initiative is running, word of mouth and online channels will bring more participants to justify the efforts _(growth hypothesis)_.
3. Testing the initiative and getting immediate feedback from students will show if our "product" is needed or not _(value hypothesis)_.
4. Early stage effort on small group lets us quickly validate and improve the offering by the time more people sign up.
