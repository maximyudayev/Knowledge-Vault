# A Review of Modern Fashion Recommender Systems
## Major Challenges
- __Item representation__ - automatic learning or hand-picking features that describe a garment.
- __Item compatibility__ - combining complementing items for a complete outfit.
- __Personalization and fit__ - stylistic matching also depends on synergy between garments and the body, not only among other garments (style is not really unique).
- __Explainability__ - visualising reasons the model made the prediction it made.
- __Forecasting trends__ - forecasting consumer preferences (function of self-projection of looks composed by designers).
