# An Informal Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
- RL interacts with the world, reasons over period of time to achieve its goals, previous observations and actions influence current prediction.
- An RL algorithm's goal is to maximize rewards over a given time period.
- Learns continually from interaction or from buffered experience.
- Recommender systems aim to not only suggest products or services that a user will like to produce higher conversion or engagement, but also to maximize internal business long-term metrics, like profit.
  It is important to setup the reward functin to maximize the company's long-term metrics (i.e. user satisfaction, etc.).
