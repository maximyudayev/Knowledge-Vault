# Best Reinforcement Learning Talks from Ray Summit 2021
- 57 talks on Ray, RL, ML, DL, Python, data processing.
- RLlib's integration to Ray allows to remove the bottleneck of sampling the single-CPU simulator environment and to speedup learning 24x.
- Amazon presented RLlib + SageMaker workflow to train and deploy robotics RL.
- Microsoft presented the use of RLlib for Offline RL to learn from real data, not a simulator, in safety critical applications where direct interaction of the RL agent is undesired due to impact of wrong decisions.
- Wildlife studios used RLlib for optimizing at any given time the In-App purchase recommendations to a user to maximize long-term profits.
