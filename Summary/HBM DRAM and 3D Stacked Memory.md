# HBM DRAM and 3D Stacked Memory
- 8-16 independent channels
- N core + 1 base die
- Chip-on-wafer processing
- ![[HBM DRAM and 3D Stacked Memory 1.png]]
	- 3D is a vertical integration of HBM on SoC in one package
	- 2.5D is integration of HBM and SoC on the same carrier wafer
- Column-to-column read speeds are limited by DRAM densities and process technology -> to increase bandwidth, must parallelize the readout
