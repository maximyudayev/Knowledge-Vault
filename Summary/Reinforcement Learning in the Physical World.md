# Reinforcement Learning in the Physical World
- Modulated gas flow across nozzles of a gas turbine to optimize efficiency and decrease the fuel consumption.
- Modifying currents in the coils to control plasmas in Tokamak fusion reactors.
- Differences between research domain and the industry:
	- Uncharted territory vs improving technologies with domain expertise.
	- Virtually no limits vs physical limitations.
	- Clean learning setup vs subject to running application constraints.
