# Time and Self-Management
## Progress
- [x] define Roles and allocate time slots
- [ ] complete SMART Goals
- [ ] complete Goal Trees
- [ ] complete Work Packages
## Methodology
1. Split ambitions and activities into distinctive life roles and allocate percentage of total time;
2. Define SMART goals for the roles;
3. Define a Goal Tree for each SMART goal;
4. Split each Work Package into tasks and estimate timing;
## Process
### Roles
#### Listed Activities
Listed activities that I do or wish to do: job, extracurricular activities, personal life, hobbies and interests, entrepreneurial ideas, side hustles, socio-educational initiatives, engineering contests, learning, etc.
#### Defined Roles
Define roles (all of them) for which complete weekly planning will be done and their corresponding desired percentages. It includes all of my personal ambitions, including academic, entrepreneurial, social, and family: the entire awake time budget (16h/d * 7d/wk = __112h/wk__) was then split across all of these roles in a seemingly fair way.  Note: Self and Time-Management ONLINE module recommends re-evaluating these percentages once every few months.
   
 ![[Time and Self-Management 1.png]]
 __Fig. 1.__ Mind map of my roles, boiled down from dreams and ambitions in life, as well as current project ideas I wish to realize in the next year. Roles are grouped into routine (left) and fulfillment (right). 
 
1. __Researcher__ - all academic and teaching duties the PhD job entails (literature review, paper writing, invigilation, lab teaching, master thesis guiding, PhD training, meetings, emails, etc.).
2. __Creator__ - all engineering, tinkering, programming, and designing activities for the hobby projects and entrepreneurial ideas (optionally inclusive of tinkering for academic projects which cannot be done as part of the "Researcher" role due to loose connection to the interests of the group, but is strongly linked to my ambitions, interests, and vision). Place to bring to life products and prototypes conceived by entrepreneurship dreams for personal projects and academia-related projects.
 <u>Note:</u> can also be used by tinkering done within the electronics club (as long as the project fits into one of the entrepreneurial ideas), and for video-editing for online (educational) content making (as long as it is used to build my own brand image and portfolio). 
3. __Learner__ - all technical, communication, and applied learning within my areas of interest (optionally inclusive of competences directly required by the "Researcher" role) to build knowledge and competences to achieve the ambitions and dreams the "Researcher", "Creator", "Entrepreneur" roles entail. 
4.  __Entrepreneur__ - dedicated time for commercialization of the ideas and prototypes developed within the "Creator" and "Researcher" roles; for networking with stakeholders; for pitching ideas; for finding growth, funding, and realization opportunities; for planning realization steps; for making pitch desks, presentations, etc. 
 <u>Note:</u> cannot be used by educational-social initiatives within the university community, like the electronics club or inter-university collaborations, communication, projects, supervision. 
5. __Family Member__ - personal time for a healthy life balance, including physical activity together with the family (climbing), and language classes.
 <u>Note:</u> might require an upsizing adjustment at the cost of downsizing other roles to have the time for other family activities. 
6. __Teacher__ - separate block for online learning content creation, editing, planning, and interacting.
 <u>Note:</u> can be absorbed by the "Creator" role, but is not recommended since it is subject to rob the role of precious time due to the nature of online content creation and editing. 
7. __Administrator__ - time for weekly reflection and planning of all the roles' tasks into the allocated weekly slots, including adjustment of plans, recalculation of role percentages, logging progress, updating Gantt charts, etc.
8. __Organizer__ - organizing formalities of the electronics club and voluntary internships with our research group; planning location and time; surveying and replying to students, staff and others; coming up with the theme; ordering components; meeting with relevant stakeholders; inviting and organizing guest lectures, company visits, and external internships. 
9. __Ambassador__ - meetings and organization of collaborations, exchanges, communication and other opportunities between universities (KU Leuven and UWI, at the moment); pitching and presenting; relaying information and emails to colleagues and the international office; proposing student projects and master theses; searching and announcing grant and funding opportunities for such international opportunities to stakeholders.   
#### Categorized Tasks
Categorized tasks for each role with the types of tasks.
1. Observed that my current roles consist of predominantly Q2 and Q3 tasks.
   ![[Time and Self-Management 2.png]] ^c08c4f
2. A lot of the Q2 tasks are without a deadline, resulting in frustrating procrastination.  ^55cb7d
3. Types of Q1 tasks are for the most part samples that are non-experienced or are rarely experienced.  ^14eb0d
4. I might prioritize tasks well on paper, but I let the little things fill up all the space and get continuously distracted or switch back and forth because of self-induced stress and anger that I don't work on the things that matter.
   ![[Time and Self-Management 3.png]] ^7ca470
5. All of my roles suffer from the same poor habits and have the same classification of tasks. ^a1f4e6
6. I am not happy with how I prioritize my work.

### Planning
#### Waterfall vs Agile
- Waterfall = serialization;
- Agile = continuous development;

Waterfall + Agile = strategic serialization with tactical iterative planning.

#### Retro vs Forward Planning
- Retro = bottom-up. Planning in reverse, from deadline to today. Deadline and goal oriented/driven.
  <u>Note:</u> Prevents underemphasizing last steps of a project;
- Forward = duration estimate-driven. Tends to take longer than a Retro planned project.
  <u>Note:</u> Prone to underemphasize middle to end parts of a project;
