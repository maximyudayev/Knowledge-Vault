## Personal Workflow
### Note Taking
Personal knowledge management (PKM) in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), using the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) method.

Allows knowledge reusability and linking = brain digital duplication.

Permits code-based diagrams and LaTex markdown.
### Scheduling
1. Split weekly agenda into slots, with respect to the percentages of each role and the desired circadian rythm.
